# Cross Device SDK

## Introduction

This SDK provides modules that will help developers drive their cross platform scenarios and interactions between Android devices and Windows PCs.

For now we have the following SDKs:

- **Continuity SDK**: The Continuity SDK enables Android applications to provide seamless cross-device resume capabilities between Android devices and Windows PCs. By integrating this SDK, partner apps can programmatically share recent tasks (such as website URLs, document links, or music tracks) from Android devices equipped with the "Link to Windows" package, allowing users to continue these tasks directly on their Windows PC.
  
    For more details, please visit [Continuity Readme](./continuity/README.md)

- **CrossDeviceExtender SDK**: The CrossDeviceExtender SDK can be used by android apps to add additional payload to their notifications such as PublisherURL and Version. This can be used to identify or redirect user to related publisher website in cross platform scenarios. This equipped with "Link To Windows" can power scenarios such as cross device installations on Windows PCs.
  
    For more details, please visit [CrossDeviceExtender Readme](./crossdeviceextender/README.md)
